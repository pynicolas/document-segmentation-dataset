# Document Segmentation Dataset

This repository contains a small, manually annotated dataset for training and evaluating document segmentation models. 
It is intended as a companion to the [document-segmentation-model](https://github.com/pynicolas/document-segmentation-model) repository, 
and is published under a restrictive license to prevent commercial reuse.

## Overview

- **Contents**: Images of documents (photos) and corresponding binary masks
- **Format**: JPEG images + PNG masks (1 channel)
- **Use case**: Semantic segmentation of documents in photos, typically as a first step in scanning workflows
- **Annotations**: Created manually using [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme)
- **License**: [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

## Structure

The dataset is available via the [Releases](https://github.com/pynicolas/document-segmentation-dataset/releases) section of this repository. It is structured as follows:

```
